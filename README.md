# Spatial Analysis of Pastoral Grazing Systems (Long Distance Transhumance and Short Distance Transhumance)

This project investigates ecological difference between **long distance transhumance (LDT)** and **short distance transhumance(SDT)** grazing sites across the Andalusian municipalities of Castril, Santiago and Pontones. Using remote sensing, GIS and topographic data, we assess vegetation dynamics on pasturelands.

> We based that analysis on the eco-anthropological Framework developed in Godoy-SepÃºlveda et al. (2024), *Governance, Mobility, and Pastureland Ecology. An EcoAnthropological Study of Three Pastoral Commons in Northeastern Andalusia*

## Project Goals

1. Extract and summarize **vegetation indices** (NDVI, NDRE, MSAVI) for buffered pasture areas.
2. Compare ecological performance of LDT vs SDT zones using:
   - **Seasonal vegetation productivity** (mean NDVI/MSAVI)
   - **Chlorophyll content proxy** (NDRE)
   - **Temporal stability / resilience** (MSAVI amplitude and persistence)
   - **Topographic constraints** (slope and aspect)
3. Evaluate whether multi-temporal vegetation patterns can help infer the **annual vs perennial composition** of plant communities.

## Workflow summary

 ### Main Steps

1. **Define grazing areas**  
   - Import polygon buffers around grazing locations  
   - Fixed radius (e.g., 500 m) 

2. **Import Sentinel-2 Harmonized imagery**  
   - Timeframe: April to July (2017, 2018, 2019)  

3. **Calculate monthly vegetation indices**  
   - **NDVI**: photosynthetic activity  
   - **MSAVI**: green biomass (better in sparse vegetation)  
   - **NDRE**: chlorophyll richness  

4. **Zonal statistics per buffer**  
   - Mean for each index  
   - Standard deviation, min, max  
   - Derived indicators:  
     - Seasonal mean  
     - Amplitude (max - min)  
     - Peak month (phenology)  
     - Persistence (`min / max` or `1 - std/mean`)

5. **Export results**  
   - CSV tables (one per year) via `Export.table.toDrive`  

6. **Comparative analysis**  
   - Compare LDT vs SDT mobility regimes  
   - Visualizations: boxplots, thematic maps, heatmaps  
   - Relate to topographic context: slope, aspect 

##  Expected Outcomes

Based on the hypotheses and conclusions of the original study, the analysis aims to verify the following patterns:

- **Greater vegetation stability** in LDT (long-distance transhumance) zones, reflected by:
  - Lower seasonal variability in MSAVI or NDVI
  - More consistent vegetation cover during the grazing season (Aprilâ€“July)

- **Higher photosynthetic activity** and **leaf pigment content** in LDT areas, evidenced by:
  - Higher NDRE values (proxy for chlorophyll richness)
  - Higher seasonal NDVI and MSAVI means

- **More favorable ecological conditions** in well-managed or strictly governed areas (Pontones), associated with:
  - Smoother seasonal profiles (lower NDVI/MSAVI fluctuation)
  - Earlier or more stable seasonal peaks (peak month patterns)

- **Challenging grazing environments** in SDT (short-distance transhumance) zones, potentially linked to:
  - Steeper slopes (mean slope higher)
  - Less favorable solar exposure (e.g., southern aspects with higher evapotranspiration)

- **Temporal vegetation dynamics** as a potential proxy for identifying areas dominated by **perennial vs. annual species**, where:
  - More persistent MSAVI/NDVI signals could indicate perennial vegetation
  - Greater amplitude and variability may reflect dominance of fast-growing annuals
