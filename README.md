# Spatial Analysis of Pastoral Grazing Systems (Long Distance Transhumance and Short Distance Transhumance)

This project investigates ecological difference between **long distance transhumance (LDT)** and **short distance transhumance(SDT)** grazing sites across the Andalusian municipalities of Castril, Santiago and Pontones. Using remote sensing, GIS and topographic data, we assess vegetation dynamics on pasturelands.

> We based that analysis on the eco-anthropological Framework developed in Godoy-Sep√∫lveda et al. (2024), *Governance, Mobility, and Pastureland Ecology. An EcoAnthropological Study of Three Pastoral Commons in Northeastern Andalusia*

## Project Goals

1. Extract and summarize **vegetation indices** (NDVI, SAVI, NDRE, MSAVI) for buffered pasture areas.
2. Compare ecological performance of LDT vs SDT zones using:
   - **Seasonal vegetation productivity** (mean NDVI/MSAVI/SAVI)
   - **Chlorophyll content proxy** (NDRE)
   - **Temporal stability** (SAVI amplitude)
   - **Topographic constraints** (slope and aspect)
3. Evaluate whether multi-temporal vegetation patterns can help infer the **annual vs perennial composition** of plant communities.

## Workflow summary

 ### Main Steps

1. **Define grazing areas**  
   - Import polygon buffers around grazing locations  
   - Fixed radius (e.g., 500 m) 

### 2. Remote Sensing Data Processing (Google Earth Engine)

- **Satellite source:** Sentinel-2 Level 2A (`COPERNICUS/S2_HARMONIZED`)
- **Time frame:** April to July, from **2017 to 2022** (transhumance period)
- Applied a **cloud mask** based on QA60 bit flags
- Computed the following vegetation indices:
  - **NDVI** ‚Äì Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
  - **SAVI** ‚Äì Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index
  - **MSAVI** ‚Äì Modified SAVI for minimal soil interference
  - **NDRE** ‚Äì Normalized Difference Red Edge Index
- For each year, calculated **mean**, **standard deviation**, and **amplitude** of each index using monthly composites (April‚ÄìJuly)
- Exported **zonal statistics** per buffer zone as a CSV file

### 3. Time Series Analysis and Charting

- Time series of vegetation indices analyzed by grazing type (LDT vs SDT)
- Comparative line charts generated for:
  - **NDVI_mean**
  - **SAVI_mean**
  - **MSAVI_mean**
  - **NDRE_mean**
- Charts created using Earth Engine and Google Sheets
- Exported an animated **SAVI time series map** (2017‚Äì2022, April‚ÄìJuly) as both **GIF** and **MP4**

## 4. Topographic and Physical Variables (QGIS)

- Used a high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to extract topographic features per buffer zone:
  - `slope_mean` ‚Äì Mean slope (¬∞) per buffer
  - `aspect_mean` ‚Äì Mean aspect (¬∞) or converted to cardinal categories (e.g., N, S, E, W)
  - `roughness` ‚Äì Surface ruggedness index (optional but included)
- All layers were clipped to buffer extent, and **zonal statistics** were computed using the **Raster > Zonal Statistics** tool in QGIS.
- Resulting values were merged with vegetation indices into a unified table for multi-variable analysis.

## 5. Descriptive Analysis by Grazing Type

- Aggregated the final dataset by **grazing mobility type** (`type_pasto`: LDT, SDT, Mixed) and **year**.
- Computed **mean** and **standard deviation** for key ecological indicators:
  - Vegetation indices:
    - `SAVI_mean`, `SAVI_std`
    - `NDRE_mean`
    - `MSAVI_mean`, `MSAVI_std`
    - `NDVI_mean`, `NDVI_std`
    - Amplitude indicators (e.g., `SAVI_amplitude`, `MSAVI_amplitude`)
  - Topographic variables:
    - `slope_mean`
    - `roughness`
    - `aspect_category` (categorical summary)
- The goal was to explore whether ecological conditions and seasonal dynamics differ significantly across mobility strategies.
